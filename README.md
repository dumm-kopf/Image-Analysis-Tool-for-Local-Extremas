# Image-Analysis-Tool-for-Local-Extremas
Tool to locate, isolate, and analyze local extremas of Gaussian nature

### About
This started as a project on analyzing confocal scans of diamond NV center samples, but the tools I developed should be able applicable on any image with local extremas, albeit with some minor tweaks. As of now the code is very much unrefined, but the main features are functional.
